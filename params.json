{"name":"S3-cache-control","tagline":"","body":"s3-cache-control\r\n================\r\nS3 does not set a default cache-control header, which means files you upload won’t be cached in the browser by default.\r\n\r\nIt is amazingly obscure how to do something as simple as setting the cache-control key in Amazon S3. The [boto document](http://boto.s3.amazonaws.com/ref/s3.html) seems to imply you could do this via key.set_metadata, but no, that won’t work because cache-control is not part of the metadata collection in the boto api. Instead, it’s part of the key attribute: http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/s3.html\r\n\r\nThis program will help you set the cache header.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to install boto.\r\n\r\n<code>pip install boto </code>\r\n\r\nNext, download set_s3_cache_header.py, modified the script to add in your AWS credential and bucket name, then run it:\r\n\r\n<code>python set_s3_cache_header.py</code>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
